<h1>Literary Intelligence Lab</h1>
<p>The Pennsylvania State University</p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The Literary Intelligence Lab (LIL) is a research and teaching initiative
kindled at The Pennsylvania State University focused on the resonances
between literary practice and artificial intelligence. In collaboration
with students and faculty at the University of South Florida, LIL explores
the boundaries and possibilities of reading, contemplation, literary experimentation and
recombinant art in the era of open source texts and AI. Undergraduate research is at the core of the LIL, the classroom our laboratory for pedagogy at scale.
</p>

<p>
Literature in the LIL names a vast archive for training, enhancing, and
entrancing attention. Together, we gather tactics for navigating,
thriving through, and creating within ever more compressed and stressed
ecologies of attention. Close and choral reading is training in immersive literacy and contemplation.
Literary Intelligence here trains Artificial Intelligence, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
The lab investigates the reading of literature as a form of pattern intelligence with
long-standing methods for modeling meaning, memory, rhetoric,affect, and
attention. Enchantment, terror, awe and mirth emerge from patterns of language and sound.
LIL brings literary and rhetorical practice into conversation
with contemporary AI systems, with particular emphasis on small language
models, choral reading,  and analog media.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Surfing the Wake in the W@ke of AI</h3>

<p>
Origin: Graduate Seminar, English 586
</p>

<p>
This project emerged from a Penn State graduate seminar devoted to
James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. It examines the Wake as a literary
system, sound archive, and source text for experimental AI research,
asking what questions and practices emerge for literature in the wake
of AI.
</p>

<p>
The project explores how collective human reading practices and small
language models respond to a text that resists conventional
interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Project components include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Choral reading of Finnegans Wake, released on flexidisk</li>
<li>An analog zine featuring notes, images, and responses</li>
<li>Linear annotations and documentation</li>
<li>Finnegans Fake 2.0, a small language model trained on choral readings of  the Wake and related sources</li>
<li>Radio Free Wakeitude, a ham radio transmission of Finnegans Wake in Morse Code, 24/7</li>
</ul>

<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>
The Literary Intelligence Lab offers classes and a pedagogical environment
supporting graduate and undergraduate instruction. Students interested
in the Lit Lab mission are encouraged to contact us for possible
collaboration. Grant writing, choral reading, hands-on work with language models, website
design, basic coding, and writing email copy are just a smidgeon of the
possibilities.
</p>

<p>
Zero-credit meditation workshops for training the mind for deep writing
and reading will be offered each semester.
</p>
